###### **McQueen Analytics**

McQueen Analytics, formerly a service of McQueen Mackin & Associates, was founded on July 18th, 2020.  Working in brokerage and banking one of the things I felt I contribute to non-profits, small businesses and start ups is the opportunity to start analytics and data driven decision making early.  Where I thrive is solutions to complex data problems and find reproducible and efficient solutions.  
  
There is so much data in this world and a lot of it is created if only by log files.  What I often found in large finance was that the bread crumbs to solutions are often kept in the data lakes that become interesting model terms.  These insights that I gleaned and how to harvest them can be vital to companies starting from scratch long before they even have large databases and making sure these kind of tidbits feed into the new product and services being given from the start.  
  
Whether you're a well established or brand new non-profit or a small business trying to keep things organized what McQueen Analytics thrives in are complex problems that need solving in reproducible ways that make your company or non-profit efficient and free to continue to have time to do what you started out to do.
